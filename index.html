        <h2>About Oregon</h2>
        <img src="images/oregon.jpg" alt="Oregon" width="200">
        <p>My home state of Oregon is a beautiful place to live. I enjoy the outdoors and all the beauty that Oregon has to offer. Oregon is known for its diverse landscapes, including forests, mountains, farms, and beaches. The state is home to Crater Lake, the deepest lake in the United States, and Mount Hood, a popular destination for skiing and snowboarding. Oregon's largest city, Portland, is famous for its vibrant arts scene, coffeehouses, and eco-friendliness. The state also has a rich history, with landmarks such as the Oregon Trail and the Lewis and Clark National Historical Park.</p>
